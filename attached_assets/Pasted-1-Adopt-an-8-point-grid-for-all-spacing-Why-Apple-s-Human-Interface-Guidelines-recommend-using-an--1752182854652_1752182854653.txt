1. Adopt an 8-point grid for all spacing
Why: Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines recommend using an 8-point increment system to keep margins and padding consistent across all screen sizes. It instantly makes layouts feel intentional and balanced.

How:

Set your base unit to 8px.

All margin/padding, gutter between cards, font-line heights, etc. should be multiples of 8px (e.g. 8, 16, 24, 32…).

2. Establish clear visual hierarchy with typography
Why: Proper font sizing and weight helps users scan, as headings “pop” and body text reads easily. Apple suggests ~17pt for body, ~20pt+ for titles, and a minimum 44pt touch target on buttons. 
DesignCode

How:

Page title (“Nick Lanahan”): 32–36px, Heavy or Semibold

Section headings (“About”, “Portfolio”, etc.): 20–24px, Medium

Body copy: 16–17px, Regular, 1.5× line-height

Ensure consistent font-stack (e.g. system-UI for a native feel).

3. Refine card layout and interactions
Equalize card heights so each section (“About”, “Portfolio”, etc.) sits in a uniform grid—no one card towers over another.

Add subtle shadows (e.g. box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) and hover-state lift to signal interactivity.

Ensure 16–24px gutter between cards and container edges (8-point grid again).

4. Tame the bottom whitespace
If it’s unintentional: check your container’s min-height or bottom padding/margin and dial it back to a multiple of 8px that still feels comfortable (e.g. 32px).

If you need space: turn it into a sticky footer with your contact links, copyright, or a simple site map. This grounds the page and makes that whitespace purposeful.

5. Simplify and elevate the header/nav
Use a transparent sticky header that on scroll switches to a subtle backdrop (e.g. white with a 1px bottom border).

Space nav items by 24–32px so they don’t crowd.

Consider a “Call-to-Action” button style (e.g. “Contact”) that uses your primary brand color, larger padding (16px vertical), and rounded corners.

6. Use sectional backgrounds or dividers
Instead of one big white expanse, alternate very light gray (#F7F7F7) bands between sections—this visually groups content blocks without extra empty space.

Alternatively, add a 1px horizontal divider (height:1px; background:#EEE; margin: 32px 0).

7. Lean on micro-interactions
Button hovers: change opacity or raise shadow.

Link underlines only on hover (keeps things clean).

Card image zoom or slight pan on hover.
