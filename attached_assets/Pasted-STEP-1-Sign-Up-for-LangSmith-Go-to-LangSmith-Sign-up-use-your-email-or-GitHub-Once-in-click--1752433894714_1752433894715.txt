STEP 1: Sign Up for LangSmith
Go to: LangSmith

Sign up (use your email or GitHub).

Once in, click on your profile icon → Settings.

Copy your LANGCHAIN_API_KEY (you’ll need this soon).

STEP 2: Add Your LangSmith Key to Replit
In your Replit project, click the “Secrets” tab (the lock icon) or use a .env file.

Add your LangSmith API key:

Key: LANGCHAIN_API_KEY

Value: (Paste your API key)

(Keep your OPENAI_API_KEY in there too!)

STEP 3: Install LangSmith (LangChain’s Monitoring Library)
In your Replit Shell, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langsmith
(You should also have langchain-openai, langchain-community, etc. already installed.)

STEP 4: Update Your Python Code to Use LangSmith
Just a few lines added to your main file (where you build your chain or call the LLM):

python
Copy
Edit
from langsmith import traceable

# If you want, you can set up the project name (optional)
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "MyPortfolioBot"  # Optional: custom project name

@traceable  # <-- This decorator traces this function to LangSmith!
def rag_pipeline(question):
    # Your retrieval, prompt, and OpenAI call logic here!
    # Example:
    results = db.similarity_search(question, k=3)
    docs = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in results])
    prompt = f"Use this info: {docs}\nQuestion: {question}"

    import openai
    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Only answer based on provided info."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content

# Example: in your FastAPI/Flask endpoint, call rag_pipeline()
The @traceable decorator tells LangSmith to log every call to that function.

You’ll see each question, retrieval result, and LLM response in the LangSmith dashboard.

STEP 5: Run Your App and See Traces in LangSmith
Start your backend (FastAPI, Flask, etc.) in Replit.

Ask questions through your chatbot or curl/Postman.

Check LangSmith Projects page – you’ll see a new project (default name or your custom one) with all your chatbot interactions.

Click on any run to inspect: the prompt, context, retrieved docs, LLM output, errors, etc.

STEP 6: (Optional) Advanced – Evaluation, Debugging, Prompt Tuning
In the LangSmith dashboard, you can:

Mark responses as good/bad.

Add “evals”: Upload test Q&A to benchmark quality.

Compare runs: See which version of your prompt or chunking performs better.

SUMMARY OF WHAT’S HAPPENING
Your production code runs on Replit as always.

Every time your app handles a user question, the interaction is logged to LangSmith (with context, prompt, answer, etc.).

You can monitor, debug, and improve your RAG chatbot from the LangSmith UI—no need to “export” models or databases.

Your backend still serves user requests; LangSmith just tracks them for you.
