Connection test shows successful authentication, API access, and proper project configuration. Ready for Phase 2 implementation.
   - **PHASE 2 COMPLETE - Automatic Tracing Implemented**: Enhanced ragPipeline and processMessage functions with comprehensive LangSmith tracing using traceable() wrapper. Added detailed metadata logging including document retrieval stats, conversation history tracking, error handling with tracing, and response analytics. All chatbot interactions now automatically generate traces in LangSmith with detailed inputs, outputs, and metadata. Verified with testing: total runs increased from 35 to 41+ confirming automatic tracing is working for all conversations.
   - **PHASE 3 COMPLETE - Comprehensive Evaluation System**: Implemented automatic evaluation system with 4 specialized criteria (Correctness, Relevance, Conciseness, Professional Tone) that evaluates every chatbot response in the background. Created comprehensive evaluation pipeline using prebuilt OpenEvals evaluators integrated with LangSmith tracing. All evaluations are automatically logged to LangSmith with detailed scoring (1-5 scale normalized to 0-1). Added admin interface evaluation tab showing real-time statistics and testing capabilities. System provides continuous quality monitoring without affecting response performance through asynchronous evaluation processing.
   - **PHASE 4 COMPLETE - Advanced Analytics & Optimization**: Implemented comprehensive analytics dashboard with performance metrics, optimization insights, and A/B testing framework. Added new Analytics tab with real-time performance trends, response time metrics, evaluation score analysis, and automated optimization recommendations. Created A/B testing infrastructure for prompt optimization experiments. Built advanced features including performance regression detection, quality improvement suggestions, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. Added comprehensive "How to Use" guide tab with step-by-step instructions for maximizing LangSmith integration benefits. Updated guide to reflect actual LangSmith interface (Runs tab instead of non-existent Evaluations tab). System now provides complete observability and optimization platform for continuous chatbot improvement.
   - **CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced Evaluation System with Source Document Verification**: Resolved the critical limitation where OpenEvals evaluators couldn't verify factual accuracy by implementing source document integration. All four evaluators (Correctness, Conciseness, Comprehensiveness, Coherence) now receive the full context of retrieved documents from the Chroma database. This enables accurate factual verification of claims about Nick's educational background, work experience, military service, and other biographical details. Evaluators can now provide accurate 10/10 scores when information is fully supported by source documents, eliminating the previous "hypothetical" scoring limitations.
   - **Improved Evaluation Reliability**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff to handle evaluation failures caused by API rate limits, network issues, or temporary service outages. System now attempts up to 3 retries for failed evaluations with improved error logging to LangSmith. This significantly reduces the number of messages that don't get evaluated, ensuring more comprehensive monitoring and quality assessment. Failed evaluations are now tracked and logged for debugging purposes.
    - **Switched to Chroma DB exclusively**: Removed document upload interface and database fallback, chatbot now uses Chroma vector database exclusively for document retrieval, eliminating warning messages and ensuring all 27 documents are properly searched via semantic similarity
   - **Removed all document upload functionality**: Deleted database document storage table (chatbot_documents), removed all document upload UI components from admin interface, removed document upload/delete API endpoints, system now relies entirely on pre-built 62MB Chroma database with existing embeddings
   - **FIXED: Chatbot now retrieves ALL documents and supports follow-up questions**: Modified retrieveRelevantDocuments to fetch all 103 documents from Chroma DB for every question (requirement #1), improved conversation history retrieval to properly store and retrieve last 10 conversations for context (requirement #2), chatbot now correctly handles follow-up questions by maintaining conversation context
  - **Added comprehensive architectural diagrams**: Created detailed visual diagrams showing complete system architecture including all servers, databases, and infrastructure components. Added new Architecture tab to admin interface displaying System Architecture, Data Flow, and AI Training Flow diagrams. Diagrams illustrate how 100+ question AI training integrates with Chroma database, LangSmith evaluation, and the complete tech stack from React frontend to PostgreSQL/Chroma databases to external services like OpenAI and LangSmith
  - **Fixed chatbot response formatting for conversational style**: Updated all system prompts (default, enhanced, custom, and LangChain) to generate SHORT, conversational responses (2-3 sentences max) instead of verbose, bullet-heavy formatted text. Reduced token limits from 500 to 150 tokens and adjusted temperature for more natural conversation flow. System now produces friendly, natural responses like "Nick has been with EY for several years, where he's taken on roles like Technology Consultant and Manager in Product Management" instead of formatted headers and bullet points
  - **Created System Prompt Manager with admin interface**: Built comprehensive system prompt management system with tabbed interface allowing admins to view and edit all 4 system prompts (Default, Enhanced, Custom, LangChain) without code access. Added API endpoints for reading and updating prompts with proper validation and error handling. Enhanced prompt shows auto-generated content with learning insights, while others are fully editable with save/cancel functionality
  - **Added System Prompt Flow Diagram**: Created visual diagram showing correct two-path structure: Training Mode (Nick uses Training prompt to ask questions and store Q&A pairs) vs Visitor Mode (Recruiters use Custom prompt if set, otherwise LangChain prompt with RAG). Fixed previous confusing diagram that incorrectly showed enhanced prompt usage. Added recommendation to simplify system by removing Enhanced prompt (becoming too large) and moving good response style guidelines to Custom prompt. Token limits (150 tokens) are set in API calls, not system prompts.
  - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: System prompt implementation mismatch identified**: Found that the admin interface shows 4 system prompts but the actual code implementation doesn't match the interface. Training mode uses hardcoded prompt in chatbotService.ts, visitor mode checks for custom template then falls back to hardcoded default, and LangChain prompt is ONLY used for document retrieval (not main chat flow). The Enhanced prompt is generated but not integrated into the main flow. This explains why editing prompts in the interface doesn't affect actual chatbot behavior.
  - **FIXED: System prompt interface now matches actual implementation**: Corrected API endpoints to read actual hardcoded prompts from chatbotService.ts and langchainChatbotService.ts, updated interface to show 3 actual prompts (Training, Visitor, Custom) plus the LangChain prompt, created API endpoints that directly edit source code files for hardcoded prompts, removed misleading Enhanced prompt from interface and flow diagram, and updated flow diagram to show that FloatingChatbot component actually uses LangChain prompt via /api/chatbot/chat endpoint - making the LangChain prompt the ACTUAL prompt used by visitors to the site (not just for document retrieval as previously described).
  - **Created centralized response formatting system**: Built responseFormatter.ts service to eliminate duplication of response style instructions across all four system prompts (Training, Visitor Fallback, Custom Template, LangChain). All prompts now use getResponseStyleInstructions() function for consistent formatting: short conversational responses (2-3 sentences), no bullet points/formatting, natural speech patterns, professional tone for recruiters. Updated database Custom template to remove redundant response style instructions. This ensures uniform response quality across all chatbot interactions regardless of which prompt is used.
  - **Made response formatting rules database-driven and editable**: Converted hardcoded response formatting instructions to database-stored rules in new `response_formatting_rules` table. Added comprehensive admin interface with new "Response Formatting" tab (5th tab, green) in system prompt manager allowing real-time editing of formatting guidelines. Created API endpoints for reading and updating formatting rules. System now loads formatting rules asynchronously from database with fallback to defaults. Added professional formatting rules including: short conversational style, recruiter-friendly tone, no bullet points, natural paragraph flow, focus on achievements and qualifications, and proper use of active voice. All chatbot responses now use these database-stored formatting rules for consistent professional appearance across all interactions.
