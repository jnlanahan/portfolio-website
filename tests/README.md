## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Not Running
```
Error: Server is not responding
Solution: Start server with `npm run dev`
```

#### Authentication Failures
```
Error: Login failed
Solution: Verify admin credentials in storage.ts
```

#### File Upload Issues
```
Error: Upload failed
Solution: Check file permissions and disk space
```

#### Database Connection
```
Error: Database operation failed
Solution: Verify database connection and schema
```

### Debug Mode
Run tests with additional logging:
```bash
DEBUG=1 node api-tests.js
```

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Tests
- User creates account → login → dashboard → create content → publish
- Admin uploads files → associates with content → public viewing
- Contact form → admin notification → response

### Edge Cases
- Empty form submissions
- Invalid file types
- Large file uploads
- Network timeouts
- Database constraints

### Error Handling
- Invalid credentials
- Missing required fields
- Server errors
- Client-side validation
- File upload failures

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
Tests can be integrated into Git hooks:
```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit
cd tests && node run-all-tests.js
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Example GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd tests && node run-all-tests.js
```
